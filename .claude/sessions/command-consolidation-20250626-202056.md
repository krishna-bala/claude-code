**Started**: 2025-06-26T20:20:56-07:00 (PDT)
**Focus**: Slash Command Consolidation

## Goals

- [ ] Implement streamlined slash command architecture (25 → 8 commands)
- [ ] Create unified `/git` command with subcommands
- [ ] Create unified `/session` command with subcommands
- [ ] Create smart `/context` command to replace load-\* commands
- [ ] Update session naming convention to `[name-]YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- [ ] Implement `/session-load` functionality for resuming sessions
- [ ] Test consolidated command workflows
- [ ] Update documentation and CLAUDE.md references

## Progress

[Session updates will appear here]

## Git State at Start

- Branch: main
- Last commit: 37c77a6 docs(claude): load navigation resources immediately
- Status: 4 modified files (including settings and context updates)

## Session Notes

Starting with comprehensive analysis showing 68% reduction possible (25 → 8 commands) while maintaining 100% functionality through better organization and subcommand structure.

Key insight: Most redundancy comes from simple file loaders that could be replaced by smart context loading or direct @-references.
