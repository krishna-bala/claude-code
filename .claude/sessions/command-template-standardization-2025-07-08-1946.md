# Context: Command Template Standardization - 2025-07-08 19:46

## Where We Left Off

- **Working on**: Standardizing all 12 user-level commands to adhere to the command template structure
- **Current status**: Successfully completed standardization of all commands with proper template sections
- **Next logical step**: Consider template improvements based on patterns discovered during standardization

## Key Discoveries

- **What worked**: Iterative approach with user approval for each command, systematic priority-based workflow
- **What didn't work**: Initially tried to avoid Bash tool usage, but learned git operations are essential for many commands
- **Important insights**: TodoRead/TodoWrite should be included in most commands, platform-agnostic language is important, HTML tags needed for PR title/description outputs

## Code Changes Made

- **Files modified**: All 12 command files standardized with template structure
  - `analyze.md` - Complete rewrite from scratch
  - `context.md` - Added missing sections + context catalog explanation
  - `debug.md` - Added template sections while preserving content
  - `save-context.md` - Added missing template sections
  - `git-commit.md` - Added Command Type, Tool Usage, Output Template, Validation
  - `generate-pr.md` - Renamed from git-pr.md, made platform-agnostic
  - `init-project.md` - Added missing sections
  - `review.md` - Added missing sections
  - `test.md` - Added missing sections
  - `setup-hooks.md` - Minor formatting improvements
  - `suggest-improvements.md` - Minor formatting improvements
  - `generate-command.md` - Reference standard, minimal changes
- **Patterns applied**: Consistent Command Type/Tool Usage/Context/Process/Output/Validation/Examples structure
- **Testing approach**: Iterative review and approval process for each command

## Useful References

- **Files to know about**:
  - `templates/command-template.md` - The master template
  - `commands/*.md` - All 12 standardized commands
  - Claude Code documentation on available tools
- **Commands that helped**: Read, Edit, Write, Glob, WebFetch for documentation research
- **Resources referenced**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#tools-available-to-claude

## Gotchas & Lessons

- **Watch out for**: Don't avoid Bash tool for git operations - it's essential for many workflows
- **Remember**: Always include TodoRead/TodoWrite in tool usage, make language platform-agnostic
- **Performance notes**: Batch tool calls when possible, use proper HTML tags for structured outputs

## To Resume This Work

- **Start by**: Review the template itself for potential improvements based on standardization experience
- **Check**: Verify all commands are working correctly with their new structure
- **Remember**: The iterative approval process worked well - continue using it for future changes

## Future Ideas

- **Next features**:
  - Template improvements based on patterns discovered
  - Additional command creation following standardized patterns
  - Documentation of command creation best practices
- **Improvements**:
  - Consider adding more guidance on tool usage patterns to template
  - Evaluate if template needs examples of command types and complexity levels
- **Technical debt**:
  - Review generate-command.md meta-recursion mentioned in original task
  - Consider updating command template based on learnings from this standardization

## Command Standardization Summary

### High Priority (Complete Restructuring)

- ✅ analyze.md - Complete rewrite
- ✅ context.md - Added missing sections + context catalog explanation
- ✅ debug.md - Added missing sections
- ✅ save-context.md - Added missing sections

### Medium Priority (Structural Improvements)

- ✅ git-commit.md - Added all missing sections
- ✅ generate-pr.md - Renamed from git-pr.md, made platform-agnostic
- ✅ init-project.md - Added missing sections
- ✅ review.md - Added all missing sections
- ✅ test.md - Added all missing sections

### Low Priority (Minor Adjustments)

- ✅ setup-hooks.md - Minor formatting
- ✅ suggest-improvements.md - Minor formatting
- ✅ generate-command.md - Reference standard

All commands now follow consistent template structure with proper tool usage patterns and comprehensive documentation.
