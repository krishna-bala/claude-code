# Analyze Reflect

Your task is to pause and provide a structured reflection on the current state of the conversation and project context.
This reflection should summarize key points, progress, insights, and next steps based on the information available to you.
Apply extending thinking to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation.

Instructions:

1. Prepare your reflection:
    In <reflection_analysis> tags inside your thinking block, organize your thoughts. 
    In this section:
      a) List key information from each section of the conversation and project context
      b) Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the information
      c) Brainstorm ideas or solutions based on the available information

    Consider each of the following aspects:
      - Context: overall conversation, objective, current phase, and key constraints
      - Progress: completed items, ongoing tasks, and blockers
      - Insights: potential risks, opportunities, and alternative approaches
      - Next Steps: immediate actions and decisions needed
      - Alignment: whether the current direction addresses core needs and if priorities should be adjusted

2. Present your reflection:
    After your preparation, present your reflection using the following markdown format:

## Alignment Check

Ensure your reflection is clear, concise, and actionable. If any section lacks information, you may write "Not yet determined" or provide suggestions based on the available context.
