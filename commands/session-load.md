# Session Load

Load/resume a previously ended development session to continue work.

## Usage

Reactivates a completed session allowing you to continue adding updates and progress tracking.

## Process

1. **List Available Sessions**

   - Scan `.claude/sessions/` for completed session files
   - Parse session metadata (name, date, focus, completion status)
   - Present sessions chronologically with summaries

2. **Session Selection**

   - If session name/pattern provided: match and load specific session
   - If no argument: show interactive list for user selection
   - Validate selected session file exists

3. **Reactivate Session**

   - Update `.claude/sessions/.current-session` with selected filename
   - Add reactivation entry to session Progress section
   - Capture current git state for context

4. **Add Reactivation Entry**

   ```markdown
   ### Session Reactivated - [Timestamp]
