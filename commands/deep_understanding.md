Your task is to pause and engage in deep understanding of the current problem or request before proceeding with implementation.
This understanding phase should unpack complexity and establish clear fundamentals that will guide all subsequent work.
Apply extended thinking to achieve an intuitive grasp of the essence without rushing to solutions.

Instructions:

1. Prepare your deep understanding analysis:
    In <deep_understanding_analysis> tags inside your thinking block, organize your thoughts.
    In this section:
      a) Define all key terms precisely
      b) Identify explicit and implicit needs
      c) Clarify all assumptions
      d) Establish clear boundaries and constraints

    Consider each of the following aspects:
      - Core Terminology: What do we mean by [key terms]?
      - Stakeholders: Who will use, maintain, or be affected by this?
      - Success Criteria: What defines success objectively?
      - Constraints: What technical, resource, or contextual limitations exist?
      - Cultural Context: What systemic or cultural factors matter?
      - Potential Misunderstandings: Where might confusion arise?

2. Present your understanding:
    After your preparation, present your understanding using the following markdown format:

# Deep Understanding Analysis

## Core Terminology
- **[Term 1]**: [Clear definition]
- **[Term 2]**: [Clear definition]
- **[Term 3]**: [Clear definition]

## Needs Assessment
- **Explicit Needs**: [Clearly stated requirements]
- **Implicit Needs**: [Underlying needs that weren't directly stated]
- **Out-of-Scope**: [What's explicitly out of scope]

## Stakeholder Analysis
- **Primary Users**: [Who will directly use this]
- **Secondary Users**: [Who will be indirectly affected]
- **Maintainers**: [Who will maintain this solution]

## Success Criteria
- **Functional Requirements**: [What must it do]
- **Non-functional Requirements**: [How well must it perform]
- **Boundaries**: [Where the solution begins and ends]

## Constraints & Context
- **Technical Constraints**: [Technical limitations]
- **Resource Constraints**: [Time, budget, personnel limitations]
- **Cultural/Contextual Factors**: [Relevant environmental factors]

## Clarification Needs
- **Assumptions Made**: [List assumptions that need validation]
- **Open Questions**: [Questions that need answers]
- **Potential Misunderstandings**: [Areas where confusion might exist]

Ensure your analysis is thorough, precise, and nuanced. If any section lacks information, indicate this explicitly with "Insufficient information" and list the specific questions needed to fill these gaps.

Only when this deep understanding phase is complete should you proceed to solution design or implementation.
