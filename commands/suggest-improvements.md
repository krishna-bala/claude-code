   - Check surrounding code patterns
   - Identify improvement opportunities

2. **Load Relevant Guidance**
   - Project-specific patterns
   - Language best practices
   - Performance guidelines
   - Security considerations

3. **Generate Suggestions**
   - Code structure improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Readability enhancements
   - Pattern consistency

4. **Prioritize and Present**
   - High-impact improvements first
   - Consider effort vs benefit
   - Provide implementation examples
