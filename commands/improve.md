**DEPRECATED - Use Specialized Agents Instead**

This command has been migrated to specialized agents for better expertise and focused improvements.

---

## Migration Guide

Instead of using `/improve`, use these specialized agents based on your improvement needs:

### üîß Code Quality Improvements
**Use: `code-reviewer` agent**

For improving:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Design patterns and architecture
- Error handling and best practices
- Code organization and structure

**Examples:**
- "improve code quality in src/"
- "make this code more maintainable"
- "suggest improvements for error handling"

### üß† Memory Framework Improvements  
**Use: `memory-framework` agent**

For improving:
- Context loading efficiency
- @-import structure optimization
- Token usage reduction
- Framework organization

**Examples:**
- "improve memory framework efficiency"
- "optimize context loading"
- "reduce token usage in framework"

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
**Use: `architect-review` agent**

For improving:
- System architecture and design
- Service boundaries and dependencies
- Scalability and maintainability
- Design pattern implementation

**Examples:**
- "improve project architecture"
- "optimize service boundaries"
- "improve system scalability"

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
**Use: `performance-engineer` agent**

For improving:
- Application performance and speed
- Database and API optimization
- Frontend performance (Core Web Vitals)
- System resource utilization

**Examples:**
- "improve application performance" 
- "optimize database queries"
- "make the app faster"

### üõ†Ô∏è Workflow & Process Improvements
**Use: `dx-optimizer` agent**

For improving:
- Development workflows
- Command organization and automation
- Team productivity processes
- Tooling and environment setup

**Examples:**
- "improve development workflow"
- "optimize command organization"
- "improve team productivity"

## Quick Reference

| Improvement Type | Agent | Key Focus |
|------------------|-------|-----------|
| Code Quality | `code-reviewer` | Code patterns, maintainability |
| Memory Framework | `memory-framework` | Context efficiency, @-imports |
| Architecture | `architect-review` | System design, scalability |
| Performance | `performance-engineer` | Speed, optimization, benchmarks |
| Workflows | `dx-optimizer` | Processes, automation, DX |

## Why This Change?

- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent has deep domain knowledge
- **Better Recommendations**: Focused analysis leads to better suggestions  
- **Consistent Patterns**: Each agent follows established improvement methodologies
- **Natural Language**: All agents understand improvement requests naturally

## Migration Examples

**Old:** `/improve memory framework token usage`
**New:** Use `memory-framework` agent: "improve memory framework token usage"

**Old:** `/improve code organization in src/`  
**New:** Use `code-reviewer` agent: "improve code organization in src/"

**Old:** `/improve project architecture`
**New:** Use `architect-review` agent: "improve project architecture"

Each specialized agent provides the same quality analysis with deeper domain expertise and more targeted recommendations.
