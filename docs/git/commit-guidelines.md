# Git Commit Guidelines

Context for making consistent, well-structured git commits.

## Commit Message Format

### Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### Rules

1. Subject line: 50 characters max, imperative mood
2. Body: Wrap at 72 characters
3. Use present tense ("add" not "added")
4. No period at end of subject line
5. Separate subject from body with blank line

## Commit Process

### Before Committing

1. Review changes: `git diff --staged`
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Check for lint issues
4. Verify no sensitive data

### Making Commits

```bash
# Stage specific changes
git add -p

# Commit with message
git commit -m "type(scope): subject"

# Or use commit template
git commit
```

### Atomic Commits

**Definition**: Ideally, each commit represents a single logical change that can be understood and reviewed independently.

**Benefits**:

- Easier code review and debugging
- Cleaner git history
- Safer reverts and cherry-picks
- Better collaboration

**Guidelines**:

- One concern per commit (fix, feature, refactor, etc.)
- Each commit should build and pass tests
- Split mixed changes into separate commits
- Use `git add -p` for partial staging
- Ask: "Does this commit do exactly one thing?"

**Examples**:

- ‚úÖ Good: "fix(auth): handle null user in login endpoint"
- ‚úÖ Good: "feat(api): add user profile endpoint"
- ‚ùå Bad: "fix login bug and add new endpoint and update docs"

### Special Instructions

- Use user-level `~/.gitmessage` template
- Do NOT add "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Follow project-specific conventions if they exist
- **Prefer multiple small commits over large ones**

## Examples

### Good Commits

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implement Google and GitHub OAuth providers with proper
error handling and token refresh logic.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint

The user endpoint was crashing when database returned
null. Added proper null checking and error response.
```

### Bad Commits

```
Fixed stuff           # Too vague
ADDED NEW FEATURE    # Wrong case, no type
update code.         # Period, not imperative
```
