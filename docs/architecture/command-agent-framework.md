# Command and Agent Framework Architecture

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Author:** Architecture Review

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural vision for evolving the Claude memory framework from a command-centric model to a hybrid command/agent architecture. The goal is to reduce complexity, improve discoverability, and provide more specialized assistance through purpose-built agents while maintaining essential command functionality for unique workflows.

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Through Separation
- **Commands**: For unique, cross-cutting functionality that doesn't fit a specific domain
- **Agents**: For specialized, domain-specific assistance with focused context

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with minimal cognitive load (2-3 commands)
- Guide users to appropriate agents based on their needs
- Provide clear pathways for discovering advanced functionality

### 3. Context Efficiency
- Load only necessary context for the task at hand
- Prevent context pollution between different workflows
- Maintain clear boundaries between different specializations

### 4. User-Centric Design
- Optimize for common workflows
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Provide clear guidance on when to use what

## Current State Analysis

### Current Command Inventory (12 commands)
1. `/analyze` - General code analysis
2. `/commands` - List available commands
3. `/debug` - Debugging assistance
4. `/documentation` - Browse documentation
5. `/generate-command` - Create new commands
6. `/generate-pr` - Generate pull requests
7. `/improve` - Code improvement suggestions
8. `/init-project` - Initialize project structure
9. `/madr` - Create architecture decision records
10. `/memory-framework` - Framework information
11. `/review` - Code review
12. `/test` - Testing assistance

### Problems with Current Approach
- **Cognitive overload**: Too many commands to remember
- **Unclear boundaries**: Overlap between commands (e.g., `/debug` vs `/analyze`)
- **Context bloat**: Commands load unnecessary context
- **Discovery friction**: Users don't know which command to use when

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Commands (2-3)

#### 1. `/madr` - Architecture Decision Records
- **Rationale**: Unique functionality not covered by existing agents
- **Use case**: Documenting architectural decisions
- **Context**: ADR templates and best practices

#### 2. `/analyze` - General Analysis Gateway
- **Rationale**: Entry point for various analysis needs
- **Use case**: Initial exploration before specialized assistance
- **Evolution**: Can suggest appropriate agents based on analysis

#### 3. `/discover` (optional)
- **Rationale**: Help users find the right agent or documentation
- **Use case**: When users don't know what they need
- **Alternative**: Could be built into base CLAUDE.md guidance

## Command vs Agent Decision Matrix

| Functionality | Command | Agent | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-------|-----------|
| ADR Creation | ✓ | | Unique workflow, template-based |
| General Analysis | ✓ | | Gateway function, broad applicability |
| Code Review | | ✓ | Specialized context, clear domain |
| Testing | | ✓ | Domain-specific, requires test framework knowledge |
| Debugging | | ✓ | Specialized techniques, focused workflow |
| PR Generation | | ✓ | Git-specific, can enhance existing agent |
| Documentation Browse | | ✓ | Part of memory-framework agent |
| Code Improvement | | ✓ | Context-dependent, multiple specialized agents |

## Workflows and User Journeys

### Journey 1: New User Onboarding
```
User: "I need help with my code"
    ↓
Base CLAUDE.md suggests /analyze
    ↓
/analyze examines code
    ↓
Suggests appropriate agent (e.g., "code-reviewer" for quality issues)
    ↓
User references agent with @agents/code-reviewer.md
```

### Journey 2: Architectural Decision
```
User: "I need to document why we chose GraphQL"
    ↓
User runs: /madr
    ↓
Command loads ADR template and guidance
    ↓
User creates structured decision record
```

### Journey 3: Complex Debugging
```
User: "My application is crashing"
    ↓
/analyze initial investigation
    ↓
Suggests @agents/debugger.md
    ↓
Debugger agent provides specialized debugging workflow
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Update base CLAUDE.md with new command/agent guidance
2. Implement `/analyze` enhancements for agent suggestions
3. Ensure `/madr` has complete functionality
4. Create migration notices in deprecated commands

### Phase 2: Agent Enhancement (Week 3-4)
1. Enhance existing agents with migrated functionality:
   - `memory-framework` agent: Add command listing, documentation browsing
   - `code-reviewer` agent: Incorporate review command features
   - `test-automator` agent: Add test command capabilities
2. Create new specialized agents as needed

### Phase 3: Deprecation (Week 5-6)
1. Add deprecation warnings to migrating commands
2. Update all documentation references
3. Provide clear migration paths in each deprecated command

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 7-8)
1. Remove deprecated commands
2. Update discovery mechanisms
3. Gather user feedback and iterate

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Command-to-Agent Handoff
```markdown
# In /analyze command response:
Based on my analysis, this appears to be a performance issue.
For specialized performance optimization, consider using:
@agents/performance-engineer.md
```

### Pattern 2: Agent Cross-Reference
```markdown
# In test-automator agent:
For debugging failing tests, you may want to use:
@agents/debugger.md
```

### Pattern 3: Context Inheritance
```markdown
# Commands can pass context to agents:
/analyze --handoff performance-engineer
# This would analyze and then suggest the agent with relevant context
```

## Discovery Mechanisms

### 1. Base CLAUDE.md Guidance
```markdown
## Getting Started
- For general analysis: Use `/analyze`
- For architectural decisions: Use `/madr`
- For specialized help: Reference agents in @agents/
```

### 2. Intelligent Suggestions
The `/analyze` command should:
- Detect code patterns
- Identify problem types
- Suggest appropriate agents
- Provide usage examples

### 3. Agent Directory
Enhance `@agents/README.md` with:
- Categorized agent listing
- Use case descriptions
- Quick selection guide
- Search functionality

## Backwards Compatibility

### Transition Period (3 months)
1. Deprecated commands remain functional
2. Show migration notices
3. Redirect to appropriate agents
4. Track usage metrics

### Command Aliases
```markdown
# In deprecated command files:
This command has been migrated to @agents/code-reviewer.md
For backwards compatibility, functionality remains available.
Migration deadline: 2025-05-01
```

### Documentation Updates
- Maintain redirect mapping
- Update all references in guides
- Provide migration documentation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Command Usage Reduction**: 12 → 2-3 commands
2. **Discovery Time**: Time to find appropriate assistance < 30 seconds
3. **Context Efficiency**: Average context size reduction of 60%
4. **Migration Completion**: 100% of users migrated within 3 months

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **User Satisfaction**: Improved ease of use feedback
2. **Task Completion**: Higher success rate for specialized tasks
3. **Learning Curve**: Reduced onboarding time for new users
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Easier to maintain and extend

### Validation Criteria
1. All core workflows remain accessible
2. No loss of functionality during migration
3. Clear documentation for all changes
4. Positive user feedback in pilot testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: User Confusion
- **Mitigation**: Clear migration guides, extended transition period

### Risk 2: Lost Functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, feature parity validation

### Risk 3: Discovery Friction
- **Mitigation**: Enhanced discovery mechanisms, intelligent suggestions

## Conclusion

This architecture represents a significant simplification of the Claude memory framework while enhancing its capabilities through specialization. By reducing cognitive load and providing clear pathways to specialized assistance, we can improve both user experience and system maintainability.

The key to success will be in the execution of the migration strategy and the quality of the discovery mechanisms we implement. With careful planning and user-centric design, this architecture will provide a more intuitive and powerful framework for AI-assisted development.
