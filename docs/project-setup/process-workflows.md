# Process Workflows

## Analysis Workflow

```
1. **Analysis Preparation** (in thinking block):
   - Define key terms precisely
   - Identify explicit and implicit needs
   - Clarify assumptions and constraints
   - Consider stakeholders, success criteria, cultural context

2. **Present Understanding** using structured format
```

## Debugging Workflow

```
### 1. Problem Analysis
- **Understand the Problem**
  - What is the expected behavior?
  - What is the actual behavior?
  - When did this start happening?
  - Can you reproduce it consistently?

### 2. Information Gathering
- **Collect Evidence**
  - Error messages and stack traces
  - Logs and debug output
  - Environment details
  - Recent changes

### 3. Hypothesis Formation
- **Generate Theories**
  - What could cause this behavior?
  - Are there similar issues in the codebase?
  - What components are involved?

### 4. Systematic Investigation
- **Test Hypotheses**
  - Add logging and debugging statements
  - Use debugger tools
  - Isolate variables and components
  - Check assumptions

### 5. Solution Implementation
- **Fix and Verify**
  - Implement the fix
  - Test thoroughly
  - Add regression tests
  - Document the solution
```

## Review Workflow

```
### 1. Understand the Context
- What problem is being solved?
- What approach was taken?
- Are there any constraints or trade-offs?

### 2. Review Changes Systematically
- Check overall structure first
- Review individual changes in detail
- Look for patterns and consistency

### 3. Evaluate Against Standards
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness

### 4. Provide Constructive Feedback
- Be specific and actionable
- Explain reasoning for suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices
- Suggest improvements, not just problems
```

## Project Initialization Workflow

```
1. **Check Existing Structure**
   - Look for existing `.claude/` directory
   - Detect project type and technologies
   - Identify build tools and frameworks

2. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create `.claude/` with specs, guides, templates, sessions
   - Initialize session tracking

3. **Generate Project CLAUDE.md**
   - Use appropriate template
   - Auto-detect build/test commands
   - Include detected tech stack
   - Add references to relevant specs
```
