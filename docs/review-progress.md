# Documentation Review Progress

## Objective
Iteratively review each documentation file in `/home/krishna/.claude/docs/` to evaluate content quality, relevance, and potential improvements. Ensure documentation follows best practices and serves its intended purpose effectively.

## Review Principles
- Apply SOLID principles to documentation (single purpose, single audience)
- Prefer natural document boundaries over arbitrary rules
- Ensure content is actionable and current
- Maintain clear navigation and cross-references
- Consolidate related content when it serves the same audience

## Completed Reviews

### 1. docs/README.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Well-structured navigation hub with domain-based organization
- Missing references to some existing files (like `context-loading-reference.md`)
- Clear categorization but could benefit from a "Getting Started" section
- Some broken references after documentation reorganization

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated references to point to `documentation-guidelines.md`
- Removed references to deleted nested directories

### 2. docs/documentation/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Directory removed

**Findings**:
- Contained separate `philosophy.md` and `strategy.md` files
- Content was related but unnecessarily split
- Violated single purpose/audience principle
- Created unnecessary directory nesting

**Actions Taken**:
- Consolidated `philosophy.md` and `strategy.md` into single `documentation-guidelines.md`
- Removed arbitrary line limit rules (e.g., "50-200 lines per file")
- Clarified `@-reference` escaping (always use backticks in examples)
- Emphasized CLAUDE.md's auto-import behavior
- Deleted the `documentation/` subdirectory
- Updated all references in README.md

**Key Changes in Consolidated File**:
- Focus on SOLID principles over rigid rules
- Natural document boundaries based on purpose/audience
- Clear `@-reference` usage examples with proper escaping
- Removed references to non-existent template files

### 3. docs/context-loading-reference.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed - File deleted

**Findings**:
- Contained outdated and inaccurate information about @-references
- Listed multiple @-references that don't actually exist in CLAUDE.md
- Referenced non-existent file paths (e.g., `~/.claude/docs/git/README.md`)
- Duplicated information already available in CLAUDE.md and docs/README.md
- Created maintenance burden with manually tracked @-references

**Actions Taken**:
- Deleted the file entirely as it served no useful purpose
- Actual @-references can be found by searching CLAUDE.md files directly
- Currently only one @-reference exists: `@docs/README.md` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Rationale for Deletion**:
- Manual tracking of @-references inevitably becomes outdated
- The file provided incorrect information that could mislead users
- All valuable content was already duplicated in authoritative sources
- Removing it reduces maintenance burden and prevents confusion

### 4. hooks-and-automation.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Well-structured documentation with clear single purpose and audience
- Technical inconsistencies: mixed sh/bash shebangs while stating hooks run in `/bin/sh`
- Missing prerequisites section (jq dependency not mentioned upfront)
- Examples assumed Mason installation without explaining dependency
- Redundant "Hook Configuration Example" section at end

**Actions Taken**:
- Added Prerequisites section listing jq and formatter/linter installation options
- Fixed all shebangs to use `#!/bin/sh` for consistency
- Added existence checks before running formatters/linters
- Enhanced error handling with `|| true` pattern throughout
- Added Performance Considerations section
- Removed redundant configuration example section
- Improved shell compatibility documentation
- Added `command -v` checks for tool availability

**Key Improvements**:
- Better error handling prevents failures when tools aren't installed
- Clear prerequisites help users set up their environment
- Consistent shell usage avoids compatibility issues
- Performance guidance helps maintain responsive hooks

### 5. testing.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Large monolithic file (178 lines) serving multiple audiences (beginners, experienced devs, teams)
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle by mixing philosophy, practices, and framework specifics
- Good content quality but poor progressive disclosure
- Outdated framework references that may become stale

**Recommendations**:
- Split into focused documents: philosophy.md, practices.md, frameworks.md
- Improve architectural boundaries between abstract principles and concrete implementations
- Add decision trees and setup checklists for better actionability
- Maintain modular structure for easier updates

### 6. git/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Contains 6 files: README.md, commit-guidelines.md, pr-guidelines.md, code-review.md, git-patterns.md, repository-management.md
- **Critical issue**: code-review.md contains copied Google documentation with broken references
- Significant redundancy between git-patterns.md and commit-guidelines.md
- Mixed abstraction levels (guidelines vs CLI commands)
- Inconsistent formatting (git-patterns.md uses condensed code-block format)

**Recommendations**:
- Remove or rewrite code-review.md completely
- Merge git-patterns.md into commit-guidelines.md
- Separate CLI tools from process guidelines
- Create missing docs: branch-guidelines.md, troubleshooting.md
- Fix broken references and improve cross-linking

### 7. memory-framework/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Contains 4 files: README.md, architecture.md, guide.md, interaction-guidelines.md
- **Critical issue**: Documentation doesn't match implementation
- Multiple broken references to non-existent files
- Directory structure examples show outdated organization
- Missing documentation of command system and agents/ directory

**Recommendations**:
- Update all structural examples to match current domain-based organization
- Fix broken references (context-loading-patterns.md, context-loading-reference.md)
- Document actual available commands, not theoretical ones
- Expand interaction-guidelines.md with concrete examples
- Add automated validation to prevent future drift

### 8. project-setup/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Contains 3 files: README.md (empty), session-management.md (high quality), setup.md
- README.md references deleted files (debugging-workflows.md, process-workflows.md)
- High overlap with memory-framework concepts
- Weak architectural boundary justifying separate directory

**Recommendations**:
- **Merge entire directory into memory-framework/**
- Move session-management.md → memory-framework/session-management.md
- Merge setup.md content into memory-framework/guide.md
- Delete hollow README.md
- Eliminate project-setup as separate concern

### 9. decisions/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Contains 6 ADRs documenting key architectural decisions
- ADRs 0001-0002 follow excellent M-ADR format
- ADRs 0003-0006 have inconsistent metadata formats and missing sections
- All decisions are current and implemented
- Missing potential ADRs for template standardization and discovery commands

**Recommendations**:
- Standardize metadata format across all ADRs
- Add missing M-ADR sections to 0003-0006
- Consider documenting command vs sub-agent delegation patterns
- Add cross-references between related decisions

### 10. templates/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Contains 5 templates: README.md, command-template.md, madr-template-minimal.md, madr-template.md, project-claude.md
- **File naming issue**: project-claude.md vs referenced project-claude-md.md
- Missing templates referenced elsewhere: spec-template.md, guide-template.md, module-template.md
- Good template quality but references to non-existent files

**Recommendations**:
- Fix naming consistency or update references
- Restore missing templates if still needed by commands
- Update templates/README.md to fix stale references
- Ensure command-template.md matches actual command structure

## Summary of Key Issues

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action
1. **memory-framework/**: Documentation doesn't match implementation
2. **git/code-review.md**: Contains broken copied content
3. **Broken references**: Multiple files reference non-existent documents
4. **project-setup/**: Should be merged into memory-framework

### Architectural Improvements
1. **testing.md**: Split into focused documents by audience/purpose
2. **git/**: Consolidate redundant content and separate concerns
3. **decisions/**: Standardize ADR formats
