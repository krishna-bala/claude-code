# Documentation Review Progress

## Objective
Iteratively review each documentation file in `/home/krishna/.claude/docs/` to evaluate content quality, relevance, and potential improvements. Ensure documentation follows best practices and serves its intended purpose effectively.

## Review Principles
- Apply SOLID principles to documentation (single purpose, single audience)
- Prefer natural document boundaries over arbitrary rules
- Ensure content is actionable and current
- Maintain clear navigation and cross-references
- Consolidate related content when it serves the same audience

## Completed Reviews

### 1. docs/README.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Findings**:
- Well-structured navigation hub with domain-based organization
- Missing references to some existing files (like `context-loading-reference.md`)
- Clear categorization but could benefit from a "Getting Started" section
- Some broken references after documentation reorganization

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated references to point to `documentation-guidelines.md`
- Removed references to deleted nested directories

### 2. docs/documentation/ Directory
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Directory removed

**Findings**:
- Contained separate `philosophy.md` and `strategy.md` files
- Content was related but unnecessarily split
- Violated single purpose/audience principle
- Created unnecessary directory nesting

**Actions Taken**:
- Consolidated `philosophy.md` and `strategy.md` into single `documentation-guidelines.md`
- Removed arbitrary line limit rules (e.g., "50-200 lines per file")
- Clarified `@-reference` escaping (always use backticks in examples)
- Emphasized CLAUDE.md's auto-import behavior
- Deleted the `documentation/` subdirectory
- Updated all references in README.md

**Key Changes in Consolidated File**:
- Focus on SOLID principles over rigid rules
- Natural document boundaries based on purpose/audience
- Clear `@-reference` usage examples with proper escaping
- Removed references to non-existent template files

### 3. docs/context-loading-reference.md
**Status**: ✅ Completed - File deleted

**Findings**:
- Contained outdated and inaccurate information about @-references
- Listed multiple @-references that don't actually exist in CLAUDE.md
- Referenced non-existent file paths (e.g., `~/.claude/docs/git/README.md`)
- Duplicated information already available in CLAUDE.md and docs/README.md
- Created maintenance burden with manually tracked @-references

**Actions Taken**:
- Deleted the file entirely as it served no useful purpose
- Actual @-references can be found by searching CLAUDE.md files directly
- Currently only one @-reference exists: `@docs/README.md` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Rationale for Deletion**:
- Manual tracking of @-references inevitably becomes outdated
- The file provided incorrect information that could mislead users
- All valuable content was already duplicated in authoritative sources
- Removing it reduces maintenance burden and prevents confusion

## Review Process
1. Read file content completely
2. Evaluate against documentation principles
3. Check for:
   - Outdated information
   - Redundancies with other files
   - Unclear or missing content
   - Structural issues
4. Propose improvements or consolidation
5. Get approval before making changes
6. Update this progress file after each review

## Next Steps
Continue with high-priority reviews:
1. `hooks-and-automation.md` - Essential for understanding tooling patterns
2. `testing.md` - Core development practice documentation

Focus areas for upcoming reviews:
- Currency and relevance to current practices
- Potential consolidation opportunities
- Clarity and actionability of content
