# Context: Knowledge Graph Validation - 2025-07-08 20:28

## Where We Left Off

- **Working on**: Conceptualizing Claude memory framework as a knowledge graph with programmatic validation
- **Current status**: Completed deep analysis of graph abstraction, node types, edge types, and validation approaches
- **Next logical step**: Implement graph discovery and validation tooling (shell script or Python)

## Key Discoveries

### What worked

- **Graph Abstraction**: Viewing the memory framework as a directed, typed graph provides clear mental model
- **Node/Edge Distinction**: Clear separation between @-imports (loading) and references (edges) clarifies behavior
- **Layered Architecture**: Entry → Knowledge → Action → Template → Session layers organize complexity
- **Validation Patterns**: Systematic approach to verify graph integrity through traversal and existence checks

### What didn't work

- **Static Analysis Limitations**: Some dynamic references can't be validated without runtime context
- **Template Complexity**: References in templates may not be valid until instantiated
- **Context Dependency**: Path resolution depends on working directory context

### Important insights

- **Graph Discovery**: Must start from entry nodes (CLAUDE.md files) and traverse to build complete picture
- **Edge Semantics**: Different edge types (@-import, reference, command, cross-reference) have distinct behaviors
- **Validation Scope**: Focus on structural integrity (do nodes exist?) rather than semantic correctness

## Code Changes Made

- **No code changes**: This was analysis and conceptual work
- **Architecture Defined**: Complete graph model with node types, edge types, and validation workflow
- **Implementation Options**: Shell-based and Python-based approaches identified

## Useful References

- **Files to know about**:
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Primary entry node
  - `~/.claude/docs/decisions/0002-reorganize-documentation-to-domain-based-structure.md` - Recent architecture change
  - `~/.claude/docs/memory-framework/architecture.md` - Framework documentation
- **Commands that helped**: `/analyze` for deep requirements analysis
- **Patterns discovered**: 37 files contain graph references, 70+ files have slash commands

## Graph Model Details

### Node Types

1. **Entry Nodes**: CLAUDE.md files (user-level, project-level, sub-level)
2. **Documentation Nodes**: docs/\*_/_.md (persistent knowledge)
3. **Command Nodes**: commands/\*_/_.md (executable functionality)
4. **Template Nodes**: templates/\*_/_.md (reusable patterns)
5. **Session Nodes**: sessions/\*_/_.md (transient context)

### Edge Types

1. **@-import Edges**: `@file.md` - Dynamic loading, creates parent-child dependency
2. **Reference Edges**: `` `file.md` `` - Pointer with description, no loading
3. **Command Edges**: `/command-name` - Maps to commands/command-name.md
4. **Cross-Reference Edges**: "See also" links - Semantic clustering

### Validation Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Traverse from entry nodes to build complete graph
2. **Validation**: Verify nodes exist, edges resolve, types match
3. **Analysis**: Detect cycles, orphaned nodes, inconsistencies
4. **Reporting**: Generate actionable validation results
5. **Maintenance**: Suggest fixes for broken references

## Gotchas & Lessons

### Watch out for

- **Circular Dependencies**: @-imports that create loading cycles
- **Context Ambiguity**: References that resolve differently based on working directory
- **Template Expansion**: References in templates that aren't valid until instantiated
- **Dynamic References**: Runtime-constructed paths that can't be statically analyzed

### Remember

- **Graph Invariants**: Acyclic @-imports, reachable from entry, valid targets, type consistency
- **Lazy Loading**: Discovery != Loading - only load nodes when needed
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Different starting contexts (user vs project level)

## To Resume This Work

### Start by

1. **Choose Implementation**: Decide between shell script (quick) or Python (robust)
2. **Build Parser**: Extract @-imports, references, commands from markdown files
3. **Implement Discovery**: Traverse from entry nodes to build graph structure
4. **Add Validation**: Check existence, resolve paths, detect cycles

### Check

- **Entry Points**: Verify ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and project/.claude/CLAUDE.md exist
- **Reference Patterns**: Confirm regex patterns match actual usage
- **Path Resolution**: Test tilde expansion, relative paths, absolute paths

### Remember

- **Graph is Directed**: Edges have clear source and target
- **Typed Edges**: Different edge types have different validation rules
- **Performance**: Discovery should be fast (<5 seconds for full graph)

## Implementation Options

### Shell Script Approach

```bash
# Extract @-imports
grep -oE '@[~/][^[:space:]]+\.md' file.md

# Extract references
grep -oE '`[~/][^`]+\.md`' file.md

# Extract commands
grep -oE '/[a-z-]+' file.md

# Validate existence
test -f "$ref" || echo "BROKEN: $ref"
```

### Python Approach

```python
import networkx as nx
from pathlib import Path

class ClaudeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()

    def discover_from_entry(self, entry_path):
        # Parse markdown for edges
        # Build graph structure
        # Validate all references
        # Return validation report
```

## Future Ideas

### Next features

- **Graph Visualization**: Generate DOT files for graphviz visualization
- **Dependency Analysis**: Show loading order and potential optimizations
- **Coverage Reporting**: Track which parts of graph are regularly accessed
- **Auto-Repair**: Suggest fixes for broken references

### Improvements

- **Caching**: Store discovered graph structure for faster subsequent validations
- **Incremental Updates**: Only re-validate changed portions of graph
- **Context-Aware**: Validation that understands current working directory
- **CI Integration**: Automated validation in development workflow

### Technical debt

- **Dynamic Reference Handling**: Better approach for runtime-constructed paths
- **Template Validation**: Separate validation for template vs instantiated content
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for large graphs
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed references

## Analysis Summary

The graph abstraction is **excellent** and provides a powerful framework for understanding and validating the Claude memory system. Key insights:

1. **Clear Mental Model**: Graph theory provides precise vocabulary for relationships
2. **Validation Strategy**: Systematic approach to verify structural integrity
3. **Implementation Path**: Clear steps from discovery to validation to reporting
4. **Extensibility**: Architecture supports future enhancements like visualization and auto-repair

This analysis establishes a solid foundation for implementing robust programmatic validation of your Claude knowledge graph.
