## Git Conventions

- Always prefix branch names with `krishna.<descriptive-name>`. When context exists (like a ticket number, API name, or module name), use `krishna.<context-identifier>.<descriptive-name>`
  - Examples:
    - `krishna.AUTO-4145.fix-login-bug` (ticket context)
    - `krishna.window-api.add-floating-support` (feature/module context)
    - `krishna.add-dark-mode` (simple feature without specific context)

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the `.gitmessage` template, `~/.claude/agent-instructions/.gitmessage`
- Do not add "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" to commit messages

## Interaction Guidelines

- Start with understanding over implementation:
  - First clarify the core need and success criteria
  - Present a high-level approach for validation before detailed work
  - For complex requests, outline key steps/components first
  - Seek explicit feedback at decision points
  - Implement incrementally rather than attempting to solve everything at once
  - Recognize when simple requests can be addressed directly
  - When assumptions must be made, make them explicit
  - Prioritize early course correction over perfect first attempts
